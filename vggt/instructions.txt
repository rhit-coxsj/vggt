Instructions for running VGGT with the rose gebru server

After cloning the repo and ssh-ing into the rose server a virtual environment is necessary to install the packages
I used the uv tool, which can be downloaded like this:

> curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

to create the vitual environment: 
> uv venv
> source .venv/bin/activate

then I used this to download all the necessary dependencies
> uv pip install -r requirements.txt
> uv pip install -r requirements_demo.txt

then I used this command to forward a port, allowing me to open the web demo own my own computer:
python demo_gradio.py --server_name 0.0.0.0 --server_port 8080

I then followed the VS code prompt to the ports tab and opened the application

From there I uploaded the photos as described in thw README and tried to reconstruct

I also tried to do the basic convention from the readme, along these lines:

import torch
from vggt.models.vggt import VGGT
from vggt.utils.load_fn import load_and_preprocess_images

device = "cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"
model = VGGT.from_pretrained("facebook/VGGT-1B").to(device)

image_names = [
    "my_scene/images/img1.jpg",
    "my_scene/images/img2.jpg",
    "my_scene/images/img3.jpg",
]

images = load_and_preprocess_images(image_names).to(device)

with torch.no_grad():
    predictions = model(images)

I did not end up getting an output due to unknown reasons
