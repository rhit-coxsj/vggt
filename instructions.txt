Instructions for running VGGT with the rose gebru server

Note: All files except instruction.txt and the generate_preds.py are from the VGGT repo and licensed as per the LICENSE.txt file

After cloning the repo and ssh-ing into the rose server a virtual environment is necessary to 
install the package dependencies outlined in this project

I used the uv tool, which can be downloaded like this:
> curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

To create and run the vitual environment: 
> uv venv
> source .venv/bin/activate

Then use pip to install the required dependencies like so:
> uv pip install -r requirements.txt
> uv pip install -r requirements_demo.txt

## TASK 1: gradio demo ##

The VGGT repo comes with an option to demo 3D environments using a local host browser, 
which was used to gather data and images for the write-up

Note: This was a somewhat backwards process, where photos were uploaded on my computer, 
sent to server to make predictions, and sent back to my computer to make 3D render. 
However, testing gradio is a good way to get novel data to share

Use this command to forward a port, allowing you to open the web demo own your own computer:
> python demo_gradio.py --server_name 0.0.0.0 --server_port 8080

Then follow the VS code prompt, or check the ports tab, to run the application

From there uploaded the photos and reconstruct

## TASK 2: simple model prediction ##

In order to run the code to generate raw predictions for run code similar to in the file generate_preds.py

Note: these file paths are for images not uploaded to the repo, so the paths and strucuture may need to be changed
